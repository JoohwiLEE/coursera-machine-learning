Coursera Machine Learning Programming Assignments
=================================================

This repository contains my attempt in solving the programming assignments for, the excellent, [Machine Learning Coursera course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

I highly recommend going through the assignments yourself as it will solidify many of the nuances of the theory covered during the lectures. I highly **discourage** for anyone to look at the solution presented in this repository **without first solving it yourself**.

However, due to the various "leaps" that one has to jump across to solve the assignment, I would be very interested to see if there is a far better way than the rather naive implementation shown here.
